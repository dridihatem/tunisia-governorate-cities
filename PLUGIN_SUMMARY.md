## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Complete Tunisian Data**
- All 24 Tunisian governorates
- Comprehensive list of cities for each governorate
- Proper French/Arabic naming conventions

### 2. **Dynamic Filtering**
- AJAX-powered city loading
- Real-time filtering based on selected governorate
- Loading indicators and error handling

### 3. **WooCommerce Integration**
- Seamless integration with checkout form
- Billing and shipping address support
- Form validation and error handling
- Order meta data storage

### 4. **User Experience**

### 5. **Admin Features**

## How It Works

### For Customers:
1. **Checkout Process**: When customers reach the WooCommerce checkout page, they'll see two new dropdown fields:
   - **Governorate**: A dropdown with all 24 Tunisian governorates
   - **City**: A dropdown that dynamically populates based on the selected governorate

2. **Dynamic Filtering**: When a customer selects a governorate, the city dropdown automatically updates via AJAX to show only cities from that governorate.

3. **Validation**: Both fields are required and validated before checkout completion.

### For Administrators:
1. **Order Management**: Governorate and city information is saved with each order and displayed in the admin order details.

2. **Data Storage**: The plugin stores the selected governorate and city as order meta data for future reference.
